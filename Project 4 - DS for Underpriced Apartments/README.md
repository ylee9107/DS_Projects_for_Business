# Data Science Showcase Project 4 â€“ App to find under-priced apartments

# App to find Under-priced Apartments:

# Introduction:

Searching for apartments that falls within your budget and location choice can be highly time consuming and frustrating. Even when a suitable apartment was found, knowing whether it is the right one is another challenge. During an apartment hunt, there are trade-off to consider such as having situated close to public transport in a city against having an elevator in the building, or time taken to walk to the nearest public transport. 

The __goal__ here is to make an application that will help the apartment hunting process that also explores these kinds of questions.

## Breakdown of this Project:
1. Inspect through the Source Apartment Listing Website with Browser.
2. Explore through HTML Data and prepare the data.
3. Visualise the Data.
4. Modelling withh Regression for Pricing.
5. Forecast the Prices according to Location.

Website Description (From Source): Apartment hunting can be overwhelming, but we realized that finding a new home isn't about looking at every apartment listing, it's about finding the best ones.

## Requirements:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Requests
- Matplotlib
- Google Map API
- Regular Expressions
- Folium
- Statsmodels API
- patsy

## Visualisation of the Apartment Prices from the model:

The diagram below shows a Choropleth (heatmap) of the Apartment prices by zip code in New York City.

## Summary

From this project, I have learnt how to acquire data online from a real estate listings webpage; to utilise pandas to manipulate and clean the data obtained. I was able to visualise the data with Folium choropleths. I was able to build a regression model to predict the rental prices on the types of apartments available in NYC.
