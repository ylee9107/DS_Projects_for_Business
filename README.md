# Data Science Project Showcase:

Welcome to my GitHub profile. This is the main page and folder that will hold most of my showcase projects. These projects will be used to demonstrate my skills as a Data Scientist in handling and tackling different types of (Data) problems, for academic, self learning, and work purposes. These projects will be presented in the form of iPython Notebooks coupled with supporting ".py" files.

Below is a chart showing the projects available to view and its short description. There will be links provided for navigation to each individual project. 

__*Disclaimer__ - When loading the files on Github, sometimes it may requires one or more page reloads to display these projects. Don't worry everything should work, it is just GitHub being finicky. (Use thhe notebook viewer links I created -> https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ in each of the Showcase Folders, found in the Introduction section.)

### Overview of the Projects for Showcase:

### Links to the Showcase Projects:
1.	[Employee Attrition](https://github.com/ylee9107/DataScience_Projects/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20DS%20for%20HR%20department) A fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists consisting of employee data for the development of a model that lowers the costs associated with hiring and training employees.
2.	[Customer Behaviour (Credit Card)](https://github.com/ylee9107/DataScience_Projects/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20DS%20For%20Marketing%20Department) Analysing a dataset containing data on various customers' bi-annual spending behaviour that are reported in monetary units. A clustering model was built to simplify and discover the internal structure, distributions and patterns of the data to produce suggestions for a marketing campaign.
3.	[Disease Detection (Covid-19)](https://github.com/ylee9107/DataScience_Projects/tree/main/Project%203%20-%20DS%20For%20Operating%20Department) Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-50) that learns to recognise a curated medical dataset consisting of Normal, Covid-19, Viral and Bacterial Pneumonia X-rays records.
4.	[Underpriced Apartment Listings](https://github.com/ylee9107/DataScience_Projects/tree/main/Project%204%20-%20DS%20for%20Underpriced%20Apartments) Designed a machine learning application that utilises a Regression model to predict prices of apartments in New York based on their location, where the data was scraped off an apartment listings website.

### My Learning Projects for Skill Improvement:

Aside from the 4 showcase projects presented above, I also have more projects to explore/view in the following links below. These will show my skills for Deep Learning, Big Data, Machine Learning and Data Science. I highly recommend exploring interesting models like Object Detection or Image Segmentation in TensorFlow 2.0 link as a start.

### Links to My Learning Projects:
1.	[TensorFlow 2.0](https://github.com/ylee9107/ComputerVisionTensorFlow2_myLearning) A repository consisting of my learning experience with TensorFlow 2.0.
2.	[PySpark](https://github.com/ylee9107/PySpark_myLearning) A repository consisting of my learning experience with Apache Spark where PySpark is the Python interface.
3.	[Feature Engineering]( https://github.com/ylee9107/FeatureEngineering_myLearning) (__Updates coming soon__)A repository consisting of my learning experience with feature engineering within the dataset for Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.
4.	[Tableau](https://github.com/ylee9107/Visual-Analytics-Project-1-footballResults) A project to show my ability to use Tableau as a data visualisation tool. 

## Future works:
-	Recommendation Engine (GitHub Profiles)
-	Image Segmentation Project (Fault Detection)
- Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
-	Learn Deep Learning with Facebookâ€™s Torch (PyTorch programming)
-	Deep Learning for video processing.
